- Open and reproducible science is really important
- The White House just came out with a mandate to make all federally funded science immediately publicly available. A groan was heard from academic publishers everywhere. Nightmarish visions of fat 40% profit margins flying out the window appeared to executives at Wiley, Springer, and Elsevier.
- Just making the papers available is only one step in the process. We also have to have all the code and data be available.
- Federal researchers work under a bunch of constraints. You cannot just throw stuff up on the cloud because there are a lot of rules about data security. For instance, you have to guarantee that no data is stored on an overseas server. Obviously that is very commonplace. For that reason and others, a lot of things that academic scientists can do without thinking twice cannot be done by federal researchers.
- There is some disconnect between federal scientists and administrators. Policies are often not clearly communicated.
- Being a good employee, I asked whether it was allowable to publish code and data associated with an analysis that I had done for a manuscript led by a USDA scientist. I wanted to put it on a permanent online repository and give it a "DOI," or permanent link that anyone could use to access it and potentially reproduce our results on their own computer. These results have to do with using a technique called genomic selection in sugarcane. Genomic selection is a powerful tool for conventional breeding (basically the closest you can get to genetic engineering without actually modifying the DNA... a cross between traditional plant breeding methods and the new school). So it is something that could potentially be of interest to a lot of people.
- Unfortunately it wasn't that simple. There are a lot of restrictions. It is a little bit of a double bind because we are encouraged to share our science, but we run up against the restriction that some of the modern tools, that are now considered open science best practices, are not available to us because it takes a long time for the federal government to approve things.
- People are afraid, justifiably, of breaking the rules so they just don't do anything.
- I am planning to work with people from the National Agricultural Library to help get some guidance out there for scientists to help them make their science as open as possible and also be sure they are following all the rules. I hope to update this soon when we get to an agreeable solution!
