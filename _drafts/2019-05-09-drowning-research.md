The cynical lobbyist [Grover Norquist](https://en.wikiquote.org/Grover_Norquist) is quoted as saying "I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub." <!--break--> Regardless of the moral bankruptcy of his agenda and worldview, at least Norquist was honest enough to state his objective outright. The dream of drowning government in the bathtub, at least when it comes to the obligation of a just government to provide for all its citizens and secure a sustainable future for them, is in ascendancy right now in Washington.
