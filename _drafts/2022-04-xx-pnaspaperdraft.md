Sometimes, the results of research don't turn out the way we expect or even want. If we're lucky enough to get media attention for the work, that complicates the picture further.

Recently, my former postdoc mentor [Mary Muth][mkm], my amazing colleague and collaborator [Kelly Hondula][klh], and I published a paper about xxx. Out of all the work I've done in my professional career so far, it's the one I'm most excited about and proudest of. MORE INTRO

## The study

We put together a bunch of different models and data about food consumption in the United States and its environmental impact. First, we figured out how much land is used in each county of the United States, and each country around the world, to produce food that people in the United States consume. Because of our globalized food system and our ability as affluent consumers to purchase expensive imported food, a full 20% of the land used to produce food in the USA is actually in other countries. Next, we converted that land footprint into a biodiversity footprint: when land is converted from natural habitat to agricultural uses, it takes away resources that animals and plants need to sustain their own populations. Even if species don't immediately go extinct when portions of their habitat are taken away, some species might not have enough land left to keep up a stable population size. So some of them might be "doomed" to eventual extinction if they don't get some of that land back. We used a few different models ... and a lot of assumptions ... to get an estimate of the number of plant, mammal, bird, amphibian, and reptile species threatened in this way by Americans' food consumption habits.

The next thing we did was run those baseline numbers through a few different scenarios. We imagined hypothetical situations where food waste was cut by 50% in the USA, meaning that Americans' consumption habits could be sustained with less land. We also imagined that overnight, all Americans switched their diet to conform with either the Dietary Guidelines of the USDA and Dept. of Health and Human Services, or the Planetary Health diet recommended by the Lancet commission. What would the consequences of those changes be for the land and biodiversity threat footprint of the American diet? 

You probably know the Dietary Guidelines from the old-school food pyramid, which has now been changed to "MyPlate.gov." There are actually three recommended diets from those guidelines. One is called healthy US-style, one is healthy Mediterranean-style, and the third is healthy vegetarian. They aren't explicitly supposed to be sustainable, but they are all supposed to be healthy. They all recommend eating less meat than Americans do now, and more fruit, veggies, and nuts. The veggie diet has plenty of animal products in the form of dairy and eggs, though, and the Med-style diet has a decent amount of seafood. By contrast, the Planetary Health diet is supposed to be both healthy and sustainable, with very little animal products in its daily allowance, but lots of fruit, grains, and nuts.

## The results

What did we find? Well, we found, unsurprisingly, that food consumption in the United States has a hefty land footprint both inside and outside the nation's borders. The largest contributor to the land footprint is the pastureland used to raise beef and dairy cattle and farmland to grow the crops used to produce animal feed. However, even though permanent crops like fruit and nut trees occupy only a small fraction of the agricultural land used to produce Americans' food, that land tends to be more intensively managed, which is more harmful to local biodiversity, and located in parts of the country and world that have higher biodiversity. This leads to a disproportionately high threat to biodiversity from those "specialty" crops, which include things like coffee and chocolate grown in the tropics and fruit and nuts from California, Florida, and Hawaii.

So far, that's not a particularly new or groundbreaking result. The interesting spin we put on it is to combine this result with simulations of "alternate realities" where the USA takes steps to improve the health and sustainability of American diets. Again, two (if not *the* two) ways of doing that are to reduce food waste and to change the composition of the average American diet. When we ran those scenarios, we found that while the healthy diets that replace meat mostly with dairy and seafood (the US-style and Mediterranean-style diets) use somewhat less land overall, it actually would have negative consequences for biodiversity if every American ate according to those recommendations. This is because replacing animal products with other animal products does not really change much of the impact, as well as because those diets replace some of the meat and added sugars and fats with fruit and nuts. Those fruits and nuts have to be produced somewhere and if we assume it will require expanding the land footprint in high-biodiversity areas, that will be harmful to the populations of plants and animals that live there. Similarly, even the vegetarian and Planetary Health diets, while they would greatly reduce the land footprint of agriculture by using a lot less pastureland, would not reduce biodiversity threat by as much as you would think just from adding up the land totals. Again this is because of their high requirement of fruit and nuts to replace animal-based sources of nutrition.

However, the results still indicate clearly that plant-based diets are the way to go for reducing the harmful impacts of the USA's food consumption on biodiversity. The other interesting result is just how well food waste reduction stacks up against these extreme diet changes (that most Americans would probably strongly resist). XXXX ADD TEXT HERE XXXX

## The headlines

We were lucky enough to get a little bit of media attention for this paper. I know it's silly to chase publications in high-profile journals but I guess that is the point: a few of those journals do get looked at by people outside the ivory tower.
